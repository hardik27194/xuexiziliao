/**
 @brief Runs the GrabCut algorithm. Operation mode is GC_INIT_WITH_RECT, which performs the 'initial segmentation'.
 The function implements the [GrabCut image segmentation algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrabCut).
 
 @param sourceImage Input 8-bit 3-channel image.
 
 @param foregroundBound ROI containing a segmented object. The pixels outside of the ROI are marked as
 "obvious background". The parameter is only used when mode==GC_INIT_WITH_RECT .
 
 @param iterationCount Number of iterations the algorithm should make before returning the result. Note
 that the result can be refined with further calls with mode==GC_INIT_WITH_MASK or
 mode==GC_EVAL .
 
 @return A binary mask image with foreground marked in black, and background marked in white.
